# My place in Church

want to build a strong base of authentic Christians, focused on living out and believing the bible, and the dogma of the church.

I want to build that up so that I can push against it, test its boundaries and its limits, and better understand how it works.

I don’t include myself in the base of Christian’s, I would rather be on the edge looking into the worldview

I’ll participate in practise, facilitate discussion, join study groups, but I don’t see myself as  the model example.

I think it’s possible people don’t believe that
