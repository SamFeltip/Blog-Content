# Spiritual Formation

Romans 12:2 #bible-verse

## Video

Conform to the world or Transform to be like Christ.

Not “shall something form me?”, instead “what will form me?”

### Unintentional Spiritual Formation

#### Active

- Habits
- Relationships
- Stories
	- [[Story of marriage]]
- Environment
	- “eco chambers of the algorithms that form our digital home”

#### Passive

Happen to us

- Time
- Experiences

Very similar to [[atomic habits]]!

[[Who am I becoming?]]
### Discussion

01 - What habits do you keep in your daily and weekly life? How might they be shaping you?

02 - Who are the most important people in your life? What do those relationships look like?

03 - As you reflect on your own journey, what stories have shaped the way you view the world and where did these stories originale?

04 - Did God reveal anything new to you in this session that you want to say more about?
