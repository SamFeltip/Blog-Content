# My Workday

My workday is typically quite stress free. I am fully remote, and I don’t have a huge amount of contact with my co workers. We have morning meetings at 9:15 on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but for the most part my job is getting the tasks I get set on a Monday to be ready for the friday two weeks following (sprints are a two week process). I’ve never been challenged on the amount of work I’m doing, but I feel I could be doing more. I often take longer lunches than I should, and I start work late + finish early. This is the first job where I feel I can actually fill the time properly, which I am not used to (typically I’m able to half arse work and get it done by the deadline, this time the work doesn’t hit the deadline if I don’t put time into it).

Completing tasks is fun, and it’s flexible. Lunchtime Is usually when I get tasks done, either putting a wash on, doing a food shop, or catching up with housemates. My routine so far is:

- Monday: make lunch at home
- Tuesday: Do a food shop, usually buy a meal deal
- Wednesday: Get food with housemates
- Thursday: go into town and have lunch with Eve, usually a meal deal. Then Work from a cafe the rest of the day
- Friday: food shop and meal deal.

I also have set up tasks for the day.

- Wednesday: shave
- Thursday: put a clothes wash on
- Friday: clear bins. I would also like to include cleaning into this time.

I also try to do a walk and pray at 3, this is noticing I drop productivity around this time. Having the brief break tends to be helpful, but sometimes I don’t get any work done between 3 and 5. I think it would be helpful if I dedicated this time to a different task. Occasionally I do sharrow vale work in this time (not great), I could have a side project at work, or review PRs in this time.

I may also go on my phone or watch YouTube throughout the day. I would estimate I do, on the low end, 2-4 hours of work a day. Work could certainly increase, especially if there was more accountability.

This setup has created a collection of things:

- I’m not as productive as I would like
- I buy lunch almost every day
- I don’t see co workers in person (as I work remotely)

I think because my work day is not scheduled, it is less productive. I should break it up with time blocks more.
