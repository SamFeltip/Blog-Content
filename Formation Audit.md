## Habits

### What Habits Make up Your Everyday Life?

#### Morning Routine

[[My morning routine]] varies depending on staying at Eve’s or my own house. Often I am late to get to work, but I almost always have breakfast, shower and get dressed before I start work. Sometimes I sleep at Eve’s, which tends to help me get out of bed on time.

#### Activities of a Typical Workday

[[My Workday]] is not as productive as I would like. I often start work late, finish early, and have longer lunches than I should. Sometimes i go on my phone or watch YouTube when I should be working. I work with tasks throughout 2 week sprints, and have 3 meetings a week. This lack of co worker contact and structure means it’s easy for me to slack.
