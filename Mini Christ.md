## About role models
The idea of cancelling people enforces the idea we’re supposed to have people in our lives we base ourselves on, that people are “pure” (mini-Christ) and we can look to them for guidance.

### Mike pilovatchi

I think it’s more appropriate to have a broad range of people in our community as peers.

I can understand why someone wouldn’t want to hear anything Mike P has said, given his past. (If someone was concerned with [[sexual purity]])

I wouldn’t go to Pilovatchi for guidance on sex or abstinence. But I would go to him for advice on prophecy, the bible, the life of Jesus etc.
