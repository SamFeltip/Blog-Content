# Marriage

The weird thing about love is you look forward to the mundane when you get to do it with someone you love.

Being content with what I have and the people around me feels almost suspicious. Like I'm not supposed to be happy. It's not expected unless I'm going on holiday. Like I'm supposed to hate my job and my wife and all the rest of my life.

There are things I'd like to change about my life, things I would like to do better. But it doesn't involve more holidays or money, it's boring or embaressing things like porn use, my sleep cycle, and my ability to _do stuff_ without putting it off forever.

Why have I not got my hair cut yet???

I guess I'm a bit worried they'd fuck it up.

## Be Proactive

Anxiety vs sloth

Worst case: your wife buys all your clothes and you have no idea about what goes on in your life.

While women often fall into anxiety and spiralling, men fall into laziness and a disinterest in _what’s more_.

## Build a Life together

Have something you work together on, that you do in collaboration. Something you’re both excited to do, and want to achieve.
