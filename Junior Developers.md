# Junior Developers

In software, Features are added by the lowest level possible. This means if a feature could be added by a junior dev, it will be.

The further down the chain of command a feature goes, the less confident the person building the thing feels they can speak out against it.

Bullshit features tend to be easy to implement. Good features tend to be hard, and they require understanding of the service and UX to build a good solution.

This means bullshit features get passed down the chain to junior devs, and since they donâ€™t have influence over product, no one can say no to bullshit features.

## Will AI Solve This?

### The Happy Path: More Focus on Product

#AI encourages smaller teams, and more senior devs behind the wheel. People more focused on UX and product can add features to products.

As the chain of command gets smaller, and the focus is more on product, and the people implementing features are more senior, we could see less bullshit features.

### Sad Path: Higher Velocity

As AI helps us ship faster, we continue encouraging juniors to pump out the same level of complexity, but at a faster rate. This means more bullshit features added by juniors.
