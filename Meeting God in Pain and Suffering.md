# Seeing God in Pain and Suffering

Matthew 26:36 #bible-verse

Not a religious formula

Slowing down can bring emotional pain to the surface
## Ways the World Deals with Emotional Pain

- Denial (spiritual bypassing)
	- using spiritual language to avoid approaching pain
	- Can get worse over time
- Detach
- Drug

## The Jesus way

Jesus goes to the garden of geesemini with disciples for Prayer

“you cannot be spiritually mature and emotionally immature”

If there is no version of our life without emotional pain, is it not part of the fall?

	“pain and suffering has been overcome by Jesus”

Plain is our pathway to transformation if we meet Jesus in our pain

## Discussion

- can you tell one painful experience that’s been used for god in your formation?
- How have you experienced god in times of pain and suffering?
- which of the three responses to emotional pain are you Moses inclined toward: demy defat h or drug?
- What could it look like for you to reorient yourself to the pain in you life as an opportunity to be formed by God?

## Spiritual exercise: noticing and naming your emotion

Notice your emotion
Name then
Feel them
Bring them to god

[[Dan Siegel]] has a lot to say about emotion.
