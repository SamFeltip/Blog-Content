# Publishing Notes as a Blog

Using Astro, obsidian, and cloudflare pages to publish my notes in real time.

Maybe I could stick in some #AI  to summarise blog posts in the preview cards?

Could use a picsum to load images for blog posts.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I find myself full of ideas, and importantly I am often repeating ideas in my head. Writing down my thoughts and revisiting them has already proven a great way to build my thoughts into ideas, rather than letting them circulate and drift.
