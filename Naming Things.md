# Naming Things

To name, to own, to understand.

I have a desire to name the things I know

It‘s like if it‘s named, it matters

Like other people will care too

Naming things makes them normal

Makes them worth noticing

Naming things makes them easier to swallow

We walk around the edges of their boundaries and fence them in.

Things are smaller when they‘re named.

- The feeling of fear before engagement
- The feeling of just being too busy
- Arguments that aren’t arguments that aren’t conversations that aren’t debates
- Feeling tired at the end of a slow day

Perhaps if I name my feelings, I’ll know everything that’s going on inside my head.

Maybe if I name all my feelings, I’ll know how to do all the things I’d like to do.

I wonder if there’s a name for that
