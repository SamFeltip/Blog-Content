# Technical Excellence

I go on a lot about technical excellence, so I should probably have some rules that make it up. Here’s what I mean.

- Be opinionated.
	- Have [[Strong opinions weakly held]]
- Be curious.
	- [[Own your seat at the table]].
	- I’ve never seen ignoring mess work out in the end.
	- Fixing problems will teach you about how “it” works.
	- [[Don’t settle for good enough]]
- [[Be progressive]].
- [[Write everything down]] and [[Work with the garage door open]].
- [[Automate your rules]]
