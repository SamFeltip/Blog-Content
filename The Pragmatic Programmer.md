# The Pragmatic Programmer

## DRY

Generate documentation from code. [[Don’t repeat yourself]] applies to [[Best practises]], too.

## Version Control

Surprised they don’t mention [[Git]], I guess it wasn’t so obviously the industry standard when this was written.

Version control for documentation!

## Debugging

[[What did types ever do for us?]]

## Engineering Daybooks

I like the idea you should always have notes with you, I would take it further and say you should [[Write everything down]].

Might as well say “use [[obsidian]]!!!”. It’s interesting they prefer paper over a file.

We work sat at our desks, it makes sense to have the day book on the PC as well. There’s a lot of value in a [[personal wiki]], there’s no reason it couldn’t take the same benefits with version control, plain text, and your editor that code does.

I like paper notes, I use them on Sundays. It’s good for rough, but I like being able to go back and revise/add to rough notes with a personal wiki.

## Design by Contract

I like the idea you should be strict on what you accept, and promise as little as possible.

I think the things you promise should always be explicitly returned. Rather than creating [[side effects]], you should always respond with exactly what has changed [[REST API]] style.

[[Design by Contract]] seems to be used over only using [[Assertions]] because it can be used alongside [[Inheritance]]. Since I prefer [[Composition over Inheritance]], I’m suspicious this is a benefit.
