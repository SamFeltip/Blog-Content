# My Morning Routine

Following the discussions of [[Habits]] in the [[Formation Audit]].

Mornings vary a lot, depending on what time I get up. In the week I need to start work at 9, but occasionally miss this deadline. This is typically because I am too slow to get out of bed; this is because I feel tired, which often causes me to stay on my phone or masturbate. These things keep me in bed for longer.

Once I’m out of bed, if I’m at my house I have shower, get dressed, and have breakfast.

Showering is fairly straightforward, washing my hair infrequently, and washing my body. I stopped moisturizing a while back, And have recently stopped using face wash - I didn’t find it helped my spots much, and left my skin feeling dry. Probably because I was using face wash and not moisturizer. I frequently forget to brush my teeth.

Getting dressed is easy enough. I have a small collection of clothes which all go together - I just pick whatever. I will often wear the same trousers and jumpers through the week - I leave them on the floor in the evening and sometimes put them back on the morning after. Or they just stay as mess on the floor.

Breakfast has become routine, too. Always coffee, sometimes I have a pint of water too. I have found drinking water significantly improves my mood. Coffee usually doesn’t taste too strong, it’s possibly because I’m using a cafetière so the extraction isn’t great. Food is two fried eggs on toast. Sometimes I forget butter so I use some from one of my housemates. Often I find I don’t have time to make a full breakfast, so I have croissants, hot cross buns or some other bread based food for breakfast. That has started since I left uni.

If I’m at Eves, It will range from getting out of bed early (I will get up and get ready to leave before she’s out of bed), or I will stay in bed until she’s almost about to leave. I don’t masturbate before I get out of bed when I stay at Eve’s house. At hers it’s similar, I still shower and get dressed, but I’ll go to my house to eat breakfast. I would probably prefer eating food at hers if I stay at hers. I leave for mine to get home at 9ish, but I very rarely get to work at 9 when I stay at hers.

I very rarely start work before I have eaten breakfast, showered or gotten dressed. Very occasionally I will skip a shower until later in the day, skip breakfast or start work in my dressing gown.
