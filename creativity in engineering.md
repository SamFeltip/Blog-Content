# Creativity in Engineering

It feels like thereâ€™s a connection between an interest in #storytelling  and an interest in software

- Picking apart a large system and understanding how they work
- Analysis of Stories is popular with so much media critique.
- Stories as collections of archetypes makes them feel as composable as software

I suppose the interest in picking things apart and understanding how they work is common. [[Engineer - know thy self!#The Scientist]]
