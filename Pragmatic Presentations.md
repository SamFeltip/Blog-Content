# Pragmatic Presentations

- Structured
	- Every opinion should be well researched
	- Should follow a strict format: premise, problem, proposal
		1. Premise: show existing landscape with research into technology and previous solutions to problem
		2. Problem: have some point you want to raise. We could use X technology, we should meet in Y way, we should organise using A, B&C.
		3. Proposal: have an easy to implement alternative/solution to the status quo. This should be the one thing that people take away. The solution should naturally follow from previous points, but will cause disagreement.
	- Dont ramble! Have your ideas formulated properly.
- Opinionated & transformative 
	- More than just a collection of facts. Should state something unique that you can bring to the table 
	- Given `premise` + `opinion`, if `problem`, then `solution`
	-
- Engaging
	- Should evoke opinion and conversation. If no one disagrees, you did something wrong!
	- Donâ€™t just click through slides. Make it lighthearted and interesting. Excalidraw is great for this?
