# Being Creative with AI

## Merging Two Worlds

”When everyone’s a developer, no one is”

On one end, it’s becoming easier for people who know how to build services to build more and build faster

Is it possible that one day people who have no technical knowledge could be building their own services using existing “primitives”? (databases, web frameworks, hosting providers etc)

It becomes easier for designers and technically minded people to turn their ides into reality.

In that world, do we have less developers or more?

## Case Studies

## Sam Robbinson

- Working head of OPs
- Responsible for building a CMS / DB For an event
- Using a prebuilt bought solution for managing data, handling forms
- Is there a world where he builds his own solution for the job?

If people are willing to pay for someone else to build a solution, they’re offloading the process of building to a third party. They’re not motivated to Try and build it in house

What would have to change for them to build it in house?

### Dan Tarrant

- Webflow developer
- His job is building websites. The sites get more advanced as he gets better at building sites
- What happens when he outgrows what webflow can let him build?

Dan is dependent on webflow as an all in one service for providing:

- UI components
- CMS
- Auth
- Booking
- Payment
- Hosting
- Analytics

If Webflow decides to change their pricing, or they change one of their services, or they stop providing some service, Dan can’t port his existing solution, or modify it beyond what webflow provides

Dan is limited by what webflow lets him build. What could he build before he had to move off webflow?

- Multi user systems / permissions
- Highly interactive systems (React/Vue)
- Advanced styles (needs custom code)
- Cross device apps (app + website in one solution)
	- Offline services
- Version control
	- CI/CD
	- A/B testing

Building what he’s making today with an some AI service would mean he could

- Swap and change his services
- Have access to a wider ecosystem of components
- Build exactly what he wants without limitation

## Who is AI For?

Most people

- Don’t care about technical details
- Don’t care about building the system themselves
- Don’t want to learn how things work
- Don’t want to build _exactly_ what they imagine

Is AI for those people?

AI can be used by people who are interested in building their own services. The question is to what extent can you ignore the Lower level (never touch the command line, never read code, never write a config file). That will decide who AI is for.

I’m not sure AI is deterministic enough to be used by people with no understanding of the services they’re building.

My experience with using AI has not been that I’m able to focus on the code less.
