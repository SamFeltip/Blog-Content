# Ideas

An Idea is a cluster of [[Subjects]]. It could also be called a proposition or a title. It encapsulates some thought into a single phrase. Well thought through ideas have a captivating title, that naturally follows from the idea’s content.

## Ideas Evoke Your Imagination

Ideas are not used by sophists, as the things sophists say are vapid and have no substance or meaning. The sophist complicates and hides their ideas with overly complicated, repetitive, verbose language. An evoker of an Idea has edited and refined their thought until they have found content that is indivisible. All the meat has been cut from the proposition until all that remains is the idea. Every word should be necessary!

## How We Formulate Ideas

Ideas start as extensive rambles. There’s nothing wrong with rambling, but it is useless if it is not cut down and refined into ideas.
