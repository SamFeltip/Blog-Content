## The Consequences of Earthly Leadership

- [[Mini Christ]]

## The Cost of Leadership

Earthly leadership is “because I’m the best, I’m in charge. And because I’m in charge, I’m what matters”

The cost of leadership is *you are not the focus*

- Directs the whole
- not the focus of attention

## How Do We Lead like God?

Christ-like Leadership means you take the wheel, but you are leading in service of “the way”

What if the cost of leadership was that you aimed not to be noticed?
